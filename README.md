# CS-370
- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  - In this project we were tasked to build a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for a pathfinding AI. We were given the coding surrounding the RL module, but not the RL itself.
- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    - Science is the study of structure and behaviour using a systematic method. Computer science applies those methods to computers, it is not enough to just be able to program a feature. Computer science stives to understand how it works and interacts with it's enviroment. More importantly computer science seeks to improve the algorithms me use and not just reproduce.
  - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    - Ask a question "what is the problem I am trying to solve?". Research the "topic". Find if any previous research has been done. Form a theory on the best answer. Setup test measures and controls. Implement the theory and observe. Docoment the outcome, form a new theory from obsevations.
  - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    - To the end user I have the responsibility to insure programs worrk as intended and do not cause any harm. To the organization I owe honest evaluation of not only my skills but the software weakness and strenghts.
